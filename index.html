		<div>Registration
</div>
		<div>Sample artwork of commissioned art by Tom Prante.
</div>
		<div>Published works require registration with respective organizations that issue international serial numbers: ISBNs for books, ISSNs for magazines and periodicals, ISMNs for musical scores, among other country-specific requirements. Vanadium Press offers to contact and register with each of these issuing agencies, and to file for copyright protections in any countries where the works will be distributed.</div>
		<div>There is so much to publishing, it would not be possible to do all services under one roof. While we do offer additional services in marketing and registration, other services such as manuscript critique require specialized teams. Nonetheless, we collaborate with others to deliver more services than those we offer in-house. 
</div>
		<div>As described on our Design page, our team of in-house designers bring years of experience creating beautiful designs and artwork for publications. For extended projects, we coordinate with a global community of illustrators, artists, photographs, animators, and other content creators to produce impressive artwork.

		<div>A publication that is well written is just as important as its design. We help pair independent authors and editors for manuscript evaluation, novel editing, synopsis consultation, reader report, and more. Concurrently with proofreading, our team continues to work on the design of the publication so that the total lead time is reduced.

</div>
		<div>With our marketing and branding services, we help new authors promote and sell their publications without requiring a large marketing budget. Utilizing social media and targeted advertisements, Vanadium Press raises awareness of products within target demographics most likely to purchase the product. Additional marketing services we offer include promotional trailers, advertisements, and website creation.
