		<div>Registration
</div>
		<div>Sample artwork by Tom Prante.
</div>
		<div>Marketing
</div>
		<div>Published works require registration with respective organizations that issue international serial numbers: ISBNs for books, ISSNs for magazines and periodicals, ISMNs for musical scores, among other country-specific requirements. Vanadium Press offers to contact and register with each of these issuing agencies, and to file for copyright protections in any countries where the works will be distributed.</div>
		<div>More Services
</div>
		<div>As described on our Design page, our team of in-house designers deliver stunning designs and artwork for most publications. For specialized subjects, such as anatomy, we coordinate with a global community of illustrators, artists, photographs, animators, and other creators to produce impressive content. 



</div>
		<div>While we offer additional services in marketing and registration, other services such as manuscript evaluation require subject matter experts. Nonetheless, we collaborate with SMEs to deliver more services than those we offer in-house to provide clients with complete publishing solutions. 
</div>
		<div>Editorial
</div>
		<div>Top: Prante, Tom. Safe Landing. 2016, Digital.
Bottom: Prante, Tom. Pharao’s Grave. 2016, Digital.
</div>
		<div>A publication that is well written is just as important as its design. We help pair independent authors and editors for manuscript evaluation, novel editing, synopsis consultation, reader report, and more. Concurrently with the editors, our team continues to work on the design of the publication so that the total project lead time is reduced.

</div>
		<div>Artwork
</div>
		<div>With our marketing and branding services, we help new authors promote and sell their publications without requiring a large marketing budget. Using social media and targeted advertisements, we raises awareness of products with target demographics and help create a strong brand image. Additional marketing services we offer include promotional trailers, advertisements, and website creation.
